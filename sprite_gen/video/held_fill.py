"""Held cells: neighbour cells of a cut that show the same picture, found, made again as the frames between the poses
beside them, and read again (docs/loop-repair.md section 7).

A clip may show a frame twice or three times in a row: a video model that stalls, a rate carried to another by
repeating frames (20 fps in 24 repeats one in six), a cut mapped to a higher rate by taking the nearer frame. Played,
the motion stops on that picture and jumps on: one pose, two or three cells. Each cut `video-loop` makes is read for
them (`same_steps`, `reading`): the cells, the poses (the cells less the ones that show their neighbour's picture
again) and each run of cells showing one picture (`held_runs`, its first cell and how many). The cells are read as
filmed, before an anchor moves each frame of a pair apart.

The same picture is a step at most CHANGED_MAX of whose subject's pixels (premultiplied) change by more than
PIXEL_SAME, read twice: on the analysis thumbnail `video-loop` cuts by and on the frames as cut. A textured figure shown
three times, encoded by libx264 at crf 18, 23 and 28 and keyed by `video-frames`, changes no thumbnail pixel of a frame
shown again by more than 0.008, 0.020 and 0.051, and 0.012 %, 0.049 % and 0.11 % of its frame's subject pixels by more
than PIXEL_SAME. An arm 8 px thick on a 120 x 140 figure grown by one pixel changes 1.2 % of the thumbnail's subject
pixels (0.38 % of the frame's); a walker going away in a frame 280 px wide changes 4.9 % of the frame's in a step that
moves none of the thumbnail's. A distance over the subject's mass (`nonloop.STABLE_MAX`, which reads a once cut's
settled end) does not part them: the arm's pixel reads under it. A small part's move of a fraction of a pixel reads as
the same picture, as a hold plays.

`fill` makes each run's cells again, between the run's first cell and the next pose, at their own times — the cells of a
run of three a third and two thirds of the way — so the cut keeps its length, its beat, its first and last cells and
its wrap: a made cell stands where a held cell stood. A run is kept as filmed where filling it would change what the
cut means: longer than HOLD_MAX cells (a drawing held on threes is three: longer is a hold the motion means), the opening
or the closing pose of a cut played once, the last cells of a loop (their next pose is across its wrap). A cut drawn on
twos or threes keeps every run (`drawn`): limited animation, each drawing shown as long as the next. It is drawn so where
its held-drawings reading (`held.measure_cycle`, which `video-cycle-align` reads) gives a hold of 2 or 3 and every run is
that long, but a run cut short at the cut's first or last cell: a clip carried to a higher rate by repeating frames
reads a hold too (24 fps carried to 60 shows each frame two or three times), its runs two and three cells by turns, and
a clip that stalls now and then reads none. A frame made
is judged as the frames the alignment makes are (`align.measure_made`, `faults`), and for a part standing still on
both sides of it (`still_kept`: a foot planted, a hand on a ledge), which must stand where it stood; a frame refused is
made again at another fraction of RETIME_T within half a cell of its own time, else the run is kept as filmed and says
why. A run is made whole or kept whole: half made it would step back.

`upsample` gives a cut at a rate above its own (`--out-fps`) its frames between, at their own times, never a frame
shown again; a cell where both frames beside its time show one picture (a hold kept) is that picture."""
