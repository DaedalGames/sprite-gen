"""A walk whose body turns inside its clip, read frame by frame (`video-loop --anchor motion-auto`, `--body-turn`;
docs/video-pipeline.md section 4, "The body turn").

A clip filmed from a still walks at the still's angle, or should: a back-diagonal walk that turns to a full back view
half way and back holds no two steps in one facing, and a cut across the turn plays the body swinging round. The
reading (`torso-side-v2`) puts each frame's torso between the clip's first frame — the still it was filmed from, a
standing pose, lead-in or not — and that frame mirrored about its head: `side = (v.s - v.m) / (1 - s.m)`, 1 where the
torso shows the side the still's does, 0 where it is as near the still as its mirror (a body seen square, from behind or
in front), under 0 past it. A pose the walk changes moves both correlations alike; a turn moves them apart. Each clip is
read against its own first frame, never against a kind of motion or a direction's name. Not against the first frame
after a lead-in (the video model reframing the still to the walk's size, which the search leaves out): that frame is a
stride's pose, whose mirror the walk draws half a cycle on, so a walk that does not turn reads a turn every stride (a
synthetic one, least -0.34). The still filmed small reads blurred, but hardly: a synthetic walk filmed from 0.6 of its
size for 8 frames reads +0.87 at least where it does not turn (+0.92 filmed from its own size), and where it turns,
the turn over the frames it reads it over filmed from its own size, a turn of 4 frames too (turning over frames 30-40,
least -0.71 against -0.63).

Four named bounds:

- SIDE_SHOWN_MIN: how far the still's head and shoulders (the top 45 % of its body) lie off their nearest mirror
  (1 - s.m; GUARD, below) for the clip to be read at all. Under it the still is seen square — a front or back walk,
  whose far step lays the torso nearer its mirror each step — and its facing is not read: a square still that turns to
  a diagonal is not seen. 0.08 lies between the synthetic walkers seen at an angle, 0.090 off it or more (the hooded
  one; the plain one 0.102), and the one seen square from behind with a 36 px piece beside its head in the still,
  0.060 at most.
- WALK_SIDE_MIN: how much nearer the still's head and shoulders than their mirror the walk's lie at the median, or
  nearer the mirror's, for the clip to be read (`walk_side`: each frame after the still, its top 45 % cropped about its
  own head as wide as the still's, against the still's and against its mirror, each at its nearest about the axes
  within GUARD px of the still's centre, v.s - v.m). Under it either way the walk is seen square: a front or back walk
  whose still shows a side its walk does not — a piece beside the head in the still alone, or the still taken where
  the arms swing apart — lies as near the still's mirror as the still, each frame's mirror a frame of the walk half a
  stride on, and read against the still it reads a turn every stride (the synthetic walker seen square from behind,
  taken 6 frames into its stride, its still 0.148 off its mirror: turns over frames 7-17, 31-41 and 55-65; its walk
  0.000 at the median). The median is of the walk's drawings, not of the time the clip gives each: a frame that is the
  frame before it held, the same pixels (the still the frame before the first), is not counted again. Each frame of a
  square walk lies as near the still's mirror as its frame half a stride on lies near the still, and a clip that holds
  one half of the stride longer than the other lay toward the half held longer at the median of its frames: the same
  walker, each drawing of the first half of each stride held 3 frames and each of the second 1 (147 frames), 0.075,
  and it read turns over frames 19-29, 67-77 and 115-125; each drawing counted once, 0.000, as on ones. A walk seen at
  an angle lies nearer the still's side (the plain walker 0.101, the hooded one
  0.090); one turned past the still's mirror over most of its frames lies nearer the mirror's, under 0, and is read with
  its turn. 0.045 lies between the synthetic walkers seen at an angle, 0.061 at least (the side walker of
  tests/video/test_walk_steps.py with a 60 px tail on a beat of its own), and those seen square: 0.000 with a piece
  beside the head or the arms swung apart in the still, 0.013 the front walker of tests/video/test_walk_steps.py with a
  70 px tail. The frames alone do not tell a front or back walk whose still shows a side from a body that turned for
  much of its walk, to face the camera or to its mirror (its frames square at the median, its still at an angle; the
  named limits below): each is left unread, and `video-loop` says so in a warning line (`square`), the cut as the search
  alone cuts it.
- TURN_SIDE_MAX: a frame whose torso reads under it is turned.
- TURN_RUN_MIN: a turn is that many turned frames in a row or more, counted in frames — the time the clip plays them —
  not in drawings: a walk held on twos holds a turn as long as one drawn on ones does, in half the drawings. A shorter
  dip is the walk's own.

Each frame is read by its mass (MASS_SHARE, the speck bound of sprite_gen/video/frames.py: a hundredth). Its box tops at
the row with a hundredth of its solid pixels over it, and the still's torso is held as wide, about the head, as the
columns of its torso rows with a hundredth of those rows' pixels beside them. A fleck apart from the body, a part of its
own cut loose (its toes, a tail's tip, an ornament) or a thin part (an antenna, a whisker) is under a hundredth and
moves neither: `torso-side-v1` read the box from the frame's topmost and outermost solid pixel, and a 3 px fleck over
the head for 10 frames read a turn over them, while an ornament cut loose beside the head hid the turn the walk made
(synthetic walkers, tests/video/test_loop_body_turn.py). The box's bottom is its last solid row, as `torso-side-v1`
read it — the one end the mass does not set: where the legs cross each stride they lay their pixels over each other,
and a bottom read by mass rises with them (the synthetic lead-in walker's, a row over its last solid row in most
frames, 3 where they cross), the crop's rows with it; its turns read over the same frames either way.

Each crop is centred on the head: the middle of the top 15 % of the body (HEAD_SHARE), of its columns holding at least
HEAD_CORE (half) of the fullest one's solid pixels — a fleck or an ornament beside the head, a few rows of each column,
does not count — read again on those within HEAD_REACH of the body's height of it until it settles. A part swung up
beside the head (a tail on a beat of its own, a held prop) would pull a plain mass centre aside every swing, and the
torso would read as turning with it (a synthetic side walk with a 60 px tail on a 45-frame beat read a turn every
swing, least -0.19); where nothing lies that far out, the middle is the mass centre itself. Where nothing lies within
HEAD_REACH of the middle — the top's parts lie apart either side of it: a prop held as high as the head and apart from
it, or a body too small for a pixel to lie that near — the top does not tell which part is the head, and the frame is
not read (None in `side`, its why in `unread`); a still not read so leaves the clip unread, cut as the search alone cuts
it. The largest part is not taken for the head: a prop can weigh what the head does in those rows (a synthetic staff's
ornament beside the head weighs the same), and a crop about the prop would read turns the body does not make, which the
cut search would leave out, or `--body-turn refuse` refuse.

The crop's axis is the middle of the centre's column (column c spans c to c + 1), and its edges lie where they fall,
between pixels too, the crop resampled from the frame about them: a body that is its own mirror about its head crops as
its own mirror wherever its centre falls (`torso-side-v1` rounded each edge to a whole pixel, and the synthetic walker
drawn in one grey lay 0.050 off its mirror, a side its silhouette does not show). A part holding over HEAD_CORE of the
fullest column in each of its own columns still moves the centre — a column 3 wide and 12 tall beside a head 19 rows
tall, 1.4 px — and read about a centre 0.75 px off, `torso-side-v1` read a walk that does not turn as turning every
stride. So each crop is read about the axes STEP (a quarter of a pixel) apart either side of the centre as well, each
as wide as the centre's:

- GUARD: the still's head and shoulders lie off their nearest mirror about any axis within 2.5 px of the centre — the
  side SIDE_SHOWN_MIN bounds — and each frame's lie nearer them or their mirror, each at its nearest (WALK_SIDE_MIN).
  The walker seen square from behind with that column 6 px beside its head in the still lies 0.060 off it; about the
  axes within 2 px, or a pixel apart, 0.093, and its walk, 0.000 at the median, is not read either way: read with
  WALK_SIDE_MIN at 0, it reads turns it does not make.
- TOL: each frame's torso is read against the still's torso and against its mirror, each at its nearest about any axis
  within 2 px of the still's centre. The walk with the still's centre read up to a pixel off reads no turn, no frame's
  side 0.07 from where it reads; the walker filmed small with that column beside its head over frames 30-39 reads no
  turn there, where read about the still's centre alone (TOL 0) it reads one. Under it, HEAD_CORE moves no synthetic
  walker's reading anywhere from 0 to 0.9: a fleck beside the head moving the centre 1.5 px (at 0.3), or an ornament
  0.9 px (at 0.35), is read within TOL.

A crop reads only what it holds. A still with no solid pixel across its torso's rows (a part apart above the body tops
its box, its narrowest row in the gap between), a crop of no width, or one of a single value throughout (an empty crop)
is not read — the still leaving the clip unread, a frame None — never read as a torso at 0, as near the still as its
mirror.

The torso (`torso_rows`) is the rows from the neck — the narrowest row of the first frame between NECK_RANGE of its
height — down half the body below it. A body with no neck narrower than its head (a hood, a robe) has its narrowest row
at the range's top, so its crop starts in the head and holds the head and the chest, which turn with it.

Named limits. A piece apart over a hundredth of the body is the body's own: it tops the box, and the frames it lies in
read as a turn where it moves the crop far enough (a synthetic 7 px fleck over the head, 49 px of a 3849 px walker,
reads its frames turned, as `torso-side-v1` did). A piece apart under the feet runs the box down to it (no turn reads
over the frames it lies in; in the still, far enough down, the still's torso reads its own mirror and the clip is not
read). The neck is read on the still's rows 2 % of its height apart: a box a pixel taller or shorter can read it a row
of the grid higher or lower, and every frame's torso rows with it. A piece beside the still's head and shoulders (its
head or an arm) can lay them under SIDE_SHOWN_MIN off their nearest mirror though the still is seen at an angle, and the
clip is not read (34 of 2191 synthetic pieces under a hundredth of the body, placed about the heads and torsos of four
walkers). A walk turned over about half its frames lies as near the still's mirror as the still at the median, as a
square walk does, and is not read: the synthetic walker turned to its mirror over 39 to 41 of its 73 frames about their
middle (38 to 41 hooded), or over 14 to 16 frames of each 24-frame cycle; over 38 or fewer (37 hooded), or 42 or more,
it is read and its turn with it. One turned to square — a back-diagonal walk turned to a full back view — and held there
over 41 of its 73 frames or more (40 hooded) is a square walk by its frames, and is not read either. Each of the three
is left unread with the warning line (`square`), not in silence. A frame is counted once only where it is the same
pixels as the frame before it: a part of the stride a clip plays slower in drawings of its own, or a held frame with
noise over it, counts frame by frame, and a square walk so played lies off the still's mirror at the median toward
that part, and over WALK_SIDE_MIN it is read, and reads turns it does not make. GUARD and TOL are pixels of the frame,
not shares of the body: a piece beside the head that moves the centre further than TOL is read about axes that do not
reach the head's, and a larger body's margin is narrower (the plain walker drawn three times as large, the column beside
its head in the still three times as large, under a hundredth: the centre moves 4.0 px, and the walk reads no turn,
least +0.31 against +0.94 without the column)."""
