"""`sprite-gen video-canvas` — pad a base still into the canvas a motion state needs.

Grok Imagine keeps the input image's framing and ignores `aspect_ratio` on
image-to-video (2026-09-08 실측: a `3:4` request still returned 960x960). So the
canvas is decided HERE, on the still: a jump needs head-room above (tall), an
attack needs room above and in front, a projectile needs room in front (wide), everything else stays square.
A walk or run filmed from the side stays square too, the square widened by whatever room the still does
not leave its silhouette for the stride and what trails behind it (`gait_room`, `--view`).
The state -> canvas table below is the single owner of that rule; `--shape`
overrides it per call, with the state's own row for that shape where it has one (a walk or run
forced wide gets no head-room).

`--fit tight` is the other way to frame: no room is added for the motion. The
empty rows above and below the subject are dropped (a little headroom stays),
the still's width is kept, and the result is padded to the nearest framing the
video model returns (9:16, 1:1, 16:9). The subject then fills as much of the
clip's height as it can, which is what keeps a fixed body height from being
upscaled at a low clip resolution; a motion that leaves that frame is clipped.

The padding is filled with the chroma key so the clip stays keyable end to end.
A still whose corners disagree is refused — a non-flat background cannot be
extended without guessing.

Image models paint "#00FF00" a little differently every time ((8, 166, 25) on
2026-09-11), and the video model reproduces the input colour almost exactly. So
when the corners are a green/magenta key at *any* brightness or balance, the flat
background is repainted to the exact declared key here — the pixels the
`cutout` chroma matte erases become the pure key, the subject is untouched —
and the padding uses that same pure key. A white/ivory base is padded with its
own corner colour as before (no chroma key to normalize to).

`--prop-plate` paints a flat magenta plate on the green key in front of the subject, a low wall for it to clear
(`prop_plate`, sized by the subject's height), and writes its box into the report, where `video-frames --prop-plate`
reads it to erase the plate from the clip's keyed frames.
