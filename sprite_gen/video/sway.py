"""`sprite-gen video-sway` — the Sway layer: a soft part of a looping body sways with the body's motion.

Its old name, `video-follow` (`sprite_gen.video.follow`, `follow_loop`), still runs it and gives the same
result. The loop's record of it is read under `sway` or `follow`; this release still writes it under
`follow`, and the strip as cut is still `follow.source.png`, the names a consumer reads them by.

A clip model draws a walk's body moving, but a soft part that hangs off it (a chest, a belly,
a pouch on a strap) mostly moves with the body as one piece, even when the prompt asks it to
bounce: at sprite size it reads as rigid. This puts that follow-through back after the loop is
cut.

Each frame of the strip is a cell of one cycle. The body's motion is read off the cells: how far
each cell's body lies from the first cell's. The silhouette is worn down from a quarter to half
of its depth in the first cell, so what swings on the body — a tail, a ponytail, an ear, a sword
or a rod held up, the legs and arms — is worn away and the head and torso are left; each cell is
laid where it overlaps the first cell most, worn alike, a pixel counting once for every level it
is still in, and then laid again on what the cells so laid have in common: what more than half of
them have at one place, so a part as thick as the body that is elsewhere in another cell (ears as
wide as the head, up in one cell and on the face in the next) does not pull that cell onto itself.
(Read off the top of the body instead, the motion was whatever came to the top: a
tail tip or a raised sword made it jump by the part's whole swing from one cell to the next.) A part
hung on the body is a damped mass: its offset x from where the body carries it answers the body's own
acceleration, x'' + 2·ζ·ω·x' + ω²·x = −body''. The loop repeats, so the answer is the periodic
steady state, solved per harmonic of the cycle: no start-up, no kick at a foot strike, and the
last frame leads into the first. `--gain` scales that physical answer and nothing else; it is
not normalised to a target size.

The part is an ellipse in the first cell (`--region cx,cy,rx,ry`, cell pixels), carried with
the body's bob. Inside it every pixel is moved by the offset times a weight that is 1 at the
centre and falls to 0 at the rim (cos²); outside it no pixel changes. The move is sampled as
premultiplied bilinear colour, so an edge never picks up the colour under a transparent pixel.
A move so large that the weight's slope folds the picture over (offset × π / (2 · radius) ≥ 1)
is refused. `--on-fold lower` gives each region the largest gain that does not fold it instead
(the offset grows in a straight line with the gain, so that gain is known without a search), and
never one under 1, the mass as measured: a region too small for that is held — it does not move,
and the record names it — and the strip is refused only when every region is.

The strip as it was before is kept as `follow.source.png` beside it; running the command again
reads from there, so a second follow-through never moves a moved strip. `video-loop` (a new
cut) and `video-cycle-align` (a new cycle) remove it, and the alignment records that the
follow-through was cleared. docs/video-pipeline.md section 6.

The regions are where somebody looked: in the first cell of the strip they were read on. An alignment
turns a loop to start elsewhere, and its first cell is then another; read again there, the motion is
taken from another cell 0 and the regions land on another place of the body. `--read-on <sha256>` names
the strip (as cut, before any follow-through) the regions were read on. That strip is this loop's own —
`same`, read as ever — or the cut this loop was aligned from (`video-cycle-align` records it, with its
reading and where every new cell is from): then the cut's reading is carried to each cell from the cut's
cell it is, the regions stay where they were read, and the damped mass is solved on the new order, length
and frame time (`transported`). A cell the alignment made between two of the cut's, or one that is not
the cut's cell pixel for pixel (a crop or a scale changed, and nothing records how), has no reading to
carry: refused `uncertain`, never carried by the nearest whole cell. Another cut of this loop's own clip,
named by `--read-on-cut STRIP` with its record beside it, is `recut`: paired by the source frame its cell 0
is, its regions and masks moved onto this loop's cell that is that frame by the whole px shift the two
crops set it apart by (`recut_pair`), never scaled. Any other strip is refused `no-match`. Without
`--read-on` nothing of this is read or written.

`--stretch-floor D` asks every region's move to leave each pixel at least D of its area. The weight's
steepest slope is π/2 over each radius, so a move (ox, oy) leaves 1 − (π/2)·hypot(ox/rx, oy/ry) of it —
by the way the region moves, where the fold rule reads the smaller radius whichever way it moves. Each
region takes the largest gain, in steps of GAIN_STEP, that keeps the floor in every cell, and never one
above what the fold rule gave it: the floor only lowers. Under it the fold rule's handling stands (under 1
held, every region held refused; `--on-fold refuse` refuses). The record names the floor and its policy.

What carries a region is the lay of the body's outline (`carry_basis`): whose pixels are inside the
carried ellipse is not read, and nothing here moves a region on a guess of it.

A strip holds 64 cells and 32,000 px across at most, so a cycle of large frames is cut down to fit it. `--frames
<folder> --out <new folder>` sways a cycle's frames themselves — a loop's `cycle/`, or what `sprite-gen breathe` wrote
from it — at their own size and count, into a new folder of the same frames under the same names and `sway.json`, as
`sprite-gen breathe` writes one. It is the same ask answered by the same code, cell for cell (`solve_cells`): a strip
cut from those frames at scale 1 with none left out, its regions moved by its crop origin, moves its cells as these
are moved, at the frame time its meta writes — rounded to hundredths of a ms, as `--fps` is read here.

A breathing idle's head stays where it is and its body moves a pixel or two: read off the outline, that motion is
whole-pixel steps, and the damped mass answers their jerks, not the breath. `--breathe <breathe.json>` sways the part
on the breath instead: the Breathe layer's record of the breath the frames were given (`sprite-gen breathe` writes it
beside them), its phases checked against those its config gives. The chest rises lift × w, w the breath of the record's
in-breath share (its config's `inhale`, the phase the in-breath peaks at); the part rises as far, late by `--lag` of a
breath (the time warp the Breathe layer's shoulders are late by), and lies the difference behind:
offset = gain × lift × (w − w late), against the way the chest rises. Where the breath rests the offset is 0 — the first
cell, and where the loop closes — and a cell whose every offset is 0 is the cell as it was, byte for byte.

A loop set's way in or out of its loop carries on the loop's breath from a cell of it: its record says the loop's
length and the cell it starts at (`sprite-gen breathe --loop-cells N --start-cell K`), and its cell i has the phase of
the loop's cell (K + i) mod N. An offset is its phase's alone, so that cell is offset as the loop's cell is, from the
stretch's first cell on — there is nothing to wind up. The fold rule and the floor read the loop's whole breath, every
cell of it, so the stretch moves by the gain the loop moves by and the record's reach is the loop's. Its regions were
read on the loop's first cell, which is not one of its frames: `--reference` names that cell, the body is read from it
and the regions are carried from there, as on the loop's own cells.

A region's fifth number, flat, is the share of the way from its centre to its rim that moves in full — the Breathe
layer's chest weight (`breathe.flat_cos2`) — so a large part moves as one piece instead of pressed in at its middle;
the fold rule and the floor read it by the radius left (1 − flat of it). `--gain-across` moves across by a gain of its
own; a gain the fold rule or the floor lowers lowers both in proportion.

`--band PX|auto` moves a region as one mass instead (`BAND_POLICY`; off by default, and off nothing of it is read or
written). The weight is 1 over the region's ellipse grown by `--band-margin` every way and falls to 0 (cos², along the
ray from the centre) over the band past it: the whole part moves, and only what is round it gives. A pixel of the part
lands where the weight is still 1 only if the flat part reaches as far as the part goes, so the margin left auto is the
move's reach and a pixel (ceil(reach) + 1), and the band left auto is the narrowest the move does not fold
(ceil(reach × π / 2) + 1): the reach is read off the move first, at the gain asked, and the band and margin from it.
The fold rule reads a region by its narrowest band, `--on-fold lower` as ever, and then the steepest its weight falls
along the move (`band_steepest`): where the flat ellipse and the outer one differ in shape the band is narrower across
its ring than its px. `--band-up FLAT[,PX|auto]` gives the
part above the centre its own: the flat part stops FLAT of the region's height over the centre and the weight falls
over PX from there — left auto, the band or as far as HANG_PAST px over the region's top, whichever is further — so the
upper part gives and the rest moves whole. A region's flat share is the other way of moving it whole and is refused
with it. A band carries each region by its own pixels, not by the body's lay: the solid pixels under its ellipse in
the cell it was read on are looked for in each cell within CARRY_SEARCH px of where the cell before had them, or of the
lay (`carry_match`, `carry_own`), and a cell where that is uncertain is carried by the lay, the record saying which and
why. Outside every region's band no pixel changes. The record holds the band, the carry of each region in every cell
and a ledger of what the move did in each cell, and what is in the ledger is said in a warning line.

`--hold-mask` (with `--band`; off by default, and off nothing of it is read or written) holds pixels the band moves
round: an arm that hangs over the part, a dress below it. The mask is a PNG drawn on the cell the regions were read on,
each of its 8-connected pieces carried into every cell by its own solid pixels as a band carries a region (`carry_mask`;
by the lay where that is uncertain, named) and grown by HOLD_GROW px for what that carry may be off by; or a folder of
one mask per cell, held as given. The move is not changed. In every cell the mask, the pixels not opaque within the
move's reach and HOLD_EDGE px of it (its soft edge, the half-clear rim of a gap beside it) and the clear pixels as near
(the air) keep their bytes. Every other pixel is read as without the mask, but a read headed into what is kept stops
short of it (`free_back`): it goes back f = min(s, h) px of its move s, h HOLD_SLOPE of how far it could go, lowered
until it rises by at most HOLD_SLOPE a px every way, and the gap the part leaves is drawn from the part stretched in
order, never read backwards: a read takes at least the move's own least area or 1 − HOLD_SLOPE of the source's,
whichever is less (`read_share`; read between neighbours, 1 − HOLD_SLOPE·√2). A read that still takes a kept pixel is
read from the others, or walked back further. The record holds the mask, the carry of each piece in every cell and a
ledger per cell (`hold_ledger`): what was kept, what was read short, and the pixels whose read takes the source
backwards, read off the move each read took.

`--region-mask` gives the region as a mask instead of the ellipse's weight (off by default, and off nothing of it is read
or written): a PNG drawn on the cell the regions were read on, or a folder of one PNG per cell. Its lower edge may be moved
to the crease under it (`--region-crease`, `crease_of`) and it is worn in by `--region-shrink` px (SHRINK_DEFAULT), so a
mask drawn a little large holds what is outside it; then it is carried into every cell by its own pixels (`carry_region`):
round where the cell before had them first and round the lay second, the lesser difference of the two that settle, and
where neither does, where the cell before had them, the record saying which and why — never the lay alone. In every cell
each visible pixel outside the mask and its soft edge keeps its bytes, and the clear pixels within the move's reach and
REGION_AIR px of it are the air it moves into. The weight is sin² of the distance to the nearest held pixel over a rim, an
ellipse of Lx across and Ly down (`rim_bands`: the fold rule's least band each way for the largest move that way, times
`--region-rim`, widened together until (π/2)·hypot(dx/Lx, dy/Ly) is at most RIM_SLOPE in every cell), so the move leaves a
pixel at least 1 − RIM_SLOPE of its area and its read stays clear of the held pixels; with `--band-up`, the lesser of that
and the upper yield's. The ellipses still say each region's gain and where `--band-up`'s shape sits. A read whose four
pixels take a held one is read from the others, and walked back only where they are half its weight, which the rim keeps
from happening. The record holds the mask, its carry in every cell and a ledger per cell (`region_ledger`). Not with
`--band`, a region's flat share, `--stretch-floor` nor `--hold-mask` (but under `--region-over`). The crease is the
picture's own edge: `--region-shrink` wears the mask in everywhere else and leaves its lower edge on the crease
(`crease_kept`).

`--region-over` (with `--region-mask`; off by default, and off nothing of it is read or written) lays the region over the
figure under it (`layer_sets`, `lay_over`): the held pixels under its lower edge, solid or not — in its columns and the
air's reach past them — are no anchor of the rim, so the lower edge moves with the rest, and the band of them within the
air's reach of it moves too and is drawn over: the region's own pixels (with its soft edge, which goes with it beside the
figure too, and its outline against the air) read at the move and laid by their alpha over the band's own pixel, which
keeps its bytes where they do not land, and over the air, which shows them and never the figure beside it; where the
region lifts, its pixels read the figure under it. `--hold-mask` names the pixels it
leaves out (an arm), carried as a band's are: never the region's, never drawn over, an anchor of the rim. `--region-shear
S` (off by default) widens the rim so a move one way rises across it the other way by at most S px a px (`shear_floor`):
the fold rule reads each way by the move along it alone, and a move down rose all at once across a rim sized for a small
move across. With either the ledger reads the region's edges too: the steps the drawn move takes (`move_steps`), the
strip a region drawn short of its side leaves standing (`still_strip`), and its tip's shape and move (`tip_shape`).

      (`jacobian`: the picture folds), and `jacobian_min`, the least area any of them takes — every read takes its whole
      move, so the move and the read are one field;

      (`cover_depth`); the held pixels are those the drawn cell keeps, the band the layer does not land on among them;
    - `edge_folded_px`: folds within a px (4-neighbour) of a held pixel, where the layer stops and the band keeps its
      bytes — the layer's edge, not the move's, so they are counted apart and the rest is read as ever.
