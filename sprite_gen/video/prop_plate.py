"""A flat magenta plate painted into a clip's still for the subject to clear, and taken out of its keyed frames
again (`video-canvas --prop-plate`, `video-frames --prop-plate`).

A vault needs something to vault. Asked in words for a wall in the background colour, a video model draws a black
slab, and keying leaves the slab in the frames. So the wall is drawn into the still instead, as a plate the key
does not take and the erase does: flat magenta on the green key, standing on the ground in front of the subject.

One box is the plate. `place` sets it on the canvas, and `video-canvas` paints it and writes it into its report
(`prop_plate.box`, canvas px, right and bottom one past). `video-frames` reads it from that report (`read`) and
erases inside it on every keyed frame (`erase`), the box carried onto the clip's frames by the ratio of their size
to the canvas's where the video model returned another size.

The plate, of the subject's height on the canvas (`canvas.subject_box`): a wall as high as the thighs (HEIGHT), a
fifth of the height thick (WIDTH), its near side GAP ahead of the subject's front (the side it faces), its foot on
the subject's foot row.

The erase: inside the box and a rim of RIM px, every pixel led by red and blue over green (by more than
MAGENTA_LEAD, red and blue within MAGENTA_BALANCE of each other: the plate, its rim blended into the key too) goes,
as does every pixel within STILL_TOLERANCE on each channel of what that pixel shows over the whole clip (the median:
the plate's keyed rim, a ground line drawn under it), since the subject crosses the box for part of the clip only.
Alpha is one of those channels, so a pixel keyed out over most of the clip is not read as black: the subject's dark
outline crossing the rim stays, as does the rest of the subject crossing in front of the plate.

A plate the video model draws a pixel off in a frame leaves its edge there, the codec's blend of magenta and green
(grey, so neither rule takes it), a line a pixel wide down each side.
