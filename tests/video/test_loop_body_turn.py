"""A walk whose body turns inside its clip (docs/video-pipeline.md section 4, "The body turn";
sprite_gen/video/body_turn.py): each frame's torso is read between the clip's first frame and that frame mirrored
(`torso-side-v2`), a turn is the torso under TURN_SIDE_MAX for TURN_RUN_MIN frames or more, and `video-loop --anchor
motion-auto` takes no cut that holds a frame of one while another holds a cycle. Where none does, `--body-turn warn`
(the default) takes the cut it took before and says so; `--body-turn refuse` refuses the clip in a line of its own. Each
frame is read by its mass: its box tops at the row with a hundredth of its solid pixels over it (MASS_SHARE), its head's
centre is read on the head's fullest columns (HEAD_CORE), and the still's torso is held as wide as the columns with a
hundredth of its torso rows' pixels beside them — a fleck or a thin part apart from the body moves none of them. Each
crop is cut about the middle of the head's centre column, its edges where they fall, between pixels too, and each frame
is read against the still and against its mirror, each at its best about any axis within TOL px of the still's head's
centre (the still's own side about any within GUARD px): a body that is its own mirror crops as its own mirror, and a
piece beside the head that moves a centre a pixel or two moves no turn.

The walker is a back diagonal seen from behind: legs side by side swinging half a cycle apart, arms either side swinging
opposite, the arm on the facing side bright and the other dim, a light panel on the torso and the cheek on the head
toward the facing. Over a turn the facing goes over to the still's mirror and back (`facing` 1 the still's three-quarter
view, 0 square from behind, under 0 past it), the arms' tones crossing. A walker drawn square from behind (`square`) is
the back walk whose still shows no side. A frame the reading cannot read — no head to centre on, no solid pixel across
the still's torso rows, a crop of no width or with nothing in it, no frames — is not read, never read as 0 or as a
middle no pixel holds. Synthetic frames only."""
