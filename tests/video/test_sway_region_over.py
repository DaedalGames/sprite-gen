"""`video-sway --region-mask` with `--region-over`, `--region-over-solid`, `--region-rim-round`, `--region-membrane` and
its four keys, `--region-shear`, and the crease the wear wears in and the layer reaches down to again.

`--region-over` lays the region over the figure under it: what lies under its lower edge is no anchor of the rim, so the
lower edge moves with the rest; the band of it within the air's reach is drawn over by the region's own pixels by their
alpha and keeps its bytes where they do not land; the air and where the region lifts are drawn by the move, the figure
under it read up there; its outline against the air goes with it and leaves the air behind, its outline against the
figure stays; `--hold-mask` names the pixels it leaves out (an arm): those the region mask covers stay the region's and
move with it, the rest are never moved and never drawn over (on a band, every one of them is held). `--region-over-solid`
lays it over the solid pixels under its lower edge alone: the rest there stays and holds the rim, and its soft edge goes
with it beside the figure under it too. `--region-rim-round` holds the rim round beside it, so below the corner where the
figure beside it stops over what lies under its lower edge the move rises down as gently as across. `--region-membrane N`
moves what lies under its lower edge within N + 1 px of it, none of what it leaves out, as a membrane between the
region's move and none on the rest of the figure (each pixel the mean of its figure neighbours' to within a pass's
MEMBRANE_STEP), drawn by that move instead of laid over; with it, `--region-membrane-unpin` makes what the membrane moves
no anchor of the rim, `--region-clear-alpha A` reads a pixel under alpha A as clear, `--region-floor-beside N` sets the
lower edge beside the region by its lowest pixel within N columns of each side, and `--region-own-outline G` grows the
region G px over the outline its mask leaves out; without it they shape nothing. `--region-shear S` widens the rim so a
move one way rises across it the other way by at most S px a px. With either, the ledger reads the steps the drawn move
takes, the strip a region drawn short of its side leaves standing, and its tip. `--region-crease` with `--region-shrink`:
the wear wears the crease in with the rest of the mask, and laid over the figure the region reaches down to the crease
again in every cell. Synthetic figures only: the region test's body and its striped part over the torso's right side and
past it over the air, a dark crease under it on the torso; an arm block beside the part's lower left; a dark outline
under the part over the air; a piece of the arm's colour right under the part's lower edge, or inside the part; a few
pixels not opaque and a near-clear speck under the part's lower edge over the air; a pixel or two of the part's outline
over the air past its mask, in a row that changes from cell to cell.

Each case first reads what a sway writes with the new keys (its cells, its record), so on a release without them the
same input fails on what comes out.
