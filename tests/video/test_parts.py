"""A part on its own beat told apart from the body (sprite_gen/video/parts.py): the tail's mask read from the clip's
frames a cycle apart, on frames filmed and on frames made between two; whether it lies in front of the body or behind
it; the tail of another drawing laid behind the body in place of a frame's own without changing a pixel of the body; and
what is not laid — a tail in front of the body, a frame or a tail with no mask, an order read from nothing.

Three walkers are drawn here, 26 frames a cycle with a bob, legs and arms swinging, over a clip of three cycles. Their
sleeves and hands are the tail's orange; every part is outlined in a darker shade of its colour, as cel art is, and
drawn at four times the size and averaged, so every edge is as soft as a keyed frame's. The tail, five segments from a
root at the back, sways on its own beat of 41 frames. Seen from the side (`side`) it hangs behind the body and the near
hand swings over its root. Seen from behind it hangs over the legs and swings over the hands, in front of them: a thin
tail rooted at the small of the back (`back`), which on three frames of the clip lies wholly over a leg, and a bushy one
rooted lower with the hands hanging lower (`back_bushy`), which crosses a hand on a third of the frames and a leg on
all of them. Each pixel's share of the tail is known, and the mask is read against the pixels the tail shows in. A frame
made between two filmed ones is the walker drawn at the time between them, as an optical-flow in-between draws it.
Synthetic frames only."""
