"""A walk or run cut shorter than its state's gait floor, its steps not counted, is named a half step.

A walk or run loops on two steps. The half-period guard reads the gait floor in whole frames, rounded, so a run cut 8
frames long at 24 fps (0.33 s, under the run's 0.35 s) is taken as a cycle; the cut stays as it was, and the report and
a warning line say it is one step (`cycle.half_step`, docs/video-pipeline.md section 4)."""
